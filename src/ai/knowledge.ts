# DiscreetKit Ghana - Official Information

## About Us & Mission
DiscreetKit is a purpose-built service for young people in Ghana, designed to provide a safe, private, and confidential path to essential health testing. Our core mission is to remove barriers like fear of judgment and lack of privacy by leveraging technology for trust and anonymity. We are more than a delivery service; we are a responsible first step, connecting users to professional care when needed.

## Our Core Principles
- **Anonymity:** No accounts or names are required to place an order.
- **Privacy:** We only collect the minimum information needed for delivery (location and a contact number). This data is deleted 7 days after the order is completed.
- **Discretion:** All test kits are delivered in plain, unbranded packaging.
- **Trust:** We partner with trusted hospitals, pharmacies, and student bodies. All our test kits are WHO-approved.

## Privacy & Data Handling
-   We do not require user accounts, names, or emails.
-   We collect a delivery location and a phone number for the rider, which is masked and only visible during delivery.
-   All delivery-related information is permanently deleted 7 days after the order is completed.
-   We never sell or trade user data.

## What to do with Test Results
A self-test result is preliminary and not a medical diagnosis.
-   **Positive Result:** A positive result requires a confirmatory test. We help users connect confidentially with our partner hospitals for this.
-   **Negative Result:** A negative result is reassuring, but it's important to be aware of the window period for tests like HIV.

## Refunds & Returns
Due to the medical nature of the products, all sales are final. We cannot accept returns. If a kit arrives damaged, the user should contact us within 24 hours with their order code for a replacement.
