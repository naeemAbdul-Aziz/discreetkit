# DiscreetKit Ghana - Official Information

## About Us & Mission
DiscreetKit is a purpose-built service for young people in Ghana, designed to provide a safe, private, and confidential path to essential health products. Our core mission is to remove barriers like fear of judgment and lack of privacy by leveraging technology for trust and anonymity. We understand the stigma is real, and we are committed to being a responsible first step, connecting users to professional care *only when and how they feel comfortable*.

## Our Core Principles
- **Anonymity:** No accounts or names are required to place an order.
- **Privacy:** We only collect the minimum information needed for delivery (location and a contact number). This data is deleted 7 days after the order is completed.
- **Discretion:** All products are delivered in plain, unbranded packaging.
- **Trust:** We partner with trusted hospitals, pharmacies, and student bodies. All our test kits are WHO-approved.

-   All delivery-related information is permanently deleted 7 days after the order is completed.
-   We never sell or trade user data.

## What to do with Test Results
A self-test result is preliminary and not a medical diagnosis. We know this can be a sensitive and private matter.
-   **Positive Result:** A positive result requires a confirmatory test. We understand that visiting a clinic can be difficult due to stigma. Our partner, Marie Stopes, provides a confidential, non-judgmental environment for this. You can contact them via a private phone call or WhatsApp to discuss your options. They will respect your privacy above all else.
-   **Negative Result:** A negative result is reassuring, but it's important to be aware of the window period for tests like HIV (the time between infection and when a test can detect it).

## Refunds & Returns
Due to the medical and personal nature of our products, all sales are final. We cannot accept returns. If a product arrives damaged, the user should contact us with their order code for a replacement.
